# Java Assignment: Concrete Class, Abstract Class, and Interface

This Java program demonstrates the usage of:
- **Concrete Class**: A class that provides complete method implementations.
- **Abstract Class**: A class that may have some methods with or without implementations and cannot be instantiated directly.
- **Interface**: A contract that defines methods without implementations, which any class implementing the interface must define.

### Classes in this Program:
1. **Music** (Interface): Defines a `sound()` method that all artist should implement.
2. **Names** (Abstract Class): Defines a `names()` method and an abstract `move()` method.
3. **Grammys** (Concrete Class): Implements the `names()` method and `sound()` method from the abstract class and interface.

### Instructions:
1. Run the program to see the behavior of each class type.
